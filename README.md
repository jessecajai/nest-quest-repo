Repository for the CMIS3150 final project. Nest Quest is a lighthearted, single-player 3D exploration and collection game. The player takes the role of a swan who must gather scattered baby swans around a pond and return them safely to the nest. The game blends exploration with timed collection mechanics and risk–reward decision-making.
